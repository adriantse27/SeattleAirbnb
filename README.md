# SeattleAirbnb
 This is for Udacity Data Science Project 1

 The data csv files are saved within the folder "SeattleAirbnbData"

 I have done very little wrangling as the purpose of the analysis was mainly based on review scores and price.
Once I created subset for the rows without nulls, then the data seemed pretty clean.

Prices had to be cleaned because of dollar values, converting to floating point was the main objective

I have done preliminary exploratory analysis on coefficients and imputing some data.

Some notes would be better if there can be examples of how I can use linear regression to do analysis on this airbnb data.
